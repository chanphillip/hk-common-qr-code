# hk-common-qr-code

**This project was intended for PERSONAL USE and it might not 100% work for all situations. We are NOT responsible for any loss caused by using this library. USE carefully!**

This project should contain a JS library for QR code generation and maybe some other utility functions or playground tools to facilitate the use of Hong Kong Common QR code. It is most likely used for developers of Merchant-sided software. Currently it is based on the v1.0 specifications release by HKICL.

### Development Roadmap

* [ ] Implement a JS library for general use
* [ ] Implement a Playground tool for demo and stuff
* [ ] Consider modify for node.js
* [ ] (more...)
